üõ∞Ô∏è Space Mission Logs Contract
Overview

The Space Mission Logs Contract is a Clarity smart contract designed to record, manage, and verify space mission data on-chain ‚Äî including satellite and space probe missions.
It enables trusted operators to create missions, add telemetry logs, update mission statuses, and manage authorized operators for collaborative mission operations.

üß© Key Features
1. Mission Management

Create new missions with details such as:

Mission name

Spacecraft ID

Mission type

Launch date

Status (e.g., active, completed, failed)

Automatically tracks the mission creator as the initial operator.

2. Mission Logs

Record telemetry data for each mission, including:

Latitude, Longitude, Altitude

Speed, Temperature

Timestamp (captured using block-height)

Each log entry is uniquely identified and tied to its mission.

3. Operator Management

Add or remove mission operators who are authorized to:

Log telemetry data

Update mission status

Only the original mission operator (creator) can add or remove other operators.

4. Access Control

Prevents unauthorized users from modifying mission or log data.

Returns specific error codes for unauthorized or invalid operations:

err-owner-only ‚Üí Only contract owner access

err-not-found ‚Üí Mission or log not found

err-unauthorized ‚Üí Unauthorized access attempt
